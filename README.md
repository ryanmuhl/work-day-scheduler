# Work Day Scheduler
Challenge 5 Bootcamp

## Purpose
Create a daily planner so that a user can manage time effectively throughout the day.

## Website Functionality/Class Criteria Met
* When the Planner is open, Current Date is displayed at top of Calender.
* When the user scrolls down,  the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours. 
* When the user views the time blocks,  each block is color coded to indicate weather time was past.  Grey indicates past, Red indicates Present, Green indicates future.
* When User clicks into time block, user can enter an event.
* When save button is selected for the individual time block, then that event is saved to local storage.
* When page is re freshed,  then the event persists.


## Difficulties/Problems Encountered
* JQUERY is a new concept that I will need more time to develop.  Time was an issue this week.  Time management was adjusted to be able to catch up on modules.  Homework/Challenges have been taking a good deal of time to complete.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* BootStrap
* JAVA SCRIPT
* JQUERY
* Moment.js library (date/time)
* FontAwesome
